# Summary

This project aims to guarantee me a quick and clear reunderstanding of the
implementation of **multi-pipe** in the probable case that the notion is as
rusty as a distant memory the day I need it.

For this purpose we will **implement a pipe in C** then as an example, the
command **`echo a | cat | grep a`** execution will be dissected.

**TL;DR** Refer to the bold text.
